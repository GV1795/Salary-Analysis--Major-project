# Salary-Analysis--Major-project
# Overview
This project aims to analyze salary-related information extracted from Kaggle repositories.

# Project Structure
data: This directory contains raw and processed data used for analysis.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
scripts: Python scripts for data processing and analysis.
results: Store the results of analyses, such as visualizations and summary statistics.
Data Collection
We collected data by leveraging the GitHub API to extract information from user profiles and repositories. The gathered data includes user information, commit history, and any salary-related information available in public repositories.

# Analysis Steps
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed the raw data to remove duplicates and handle missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored the data to identify patterns, distributions, and potential outliers.
Salary Analysis: Focused on extracting salary-related information and analyzing factors that might influence developer salaries.
Visualization: Created visualizations to present key findings and trends.
Statistical Analysis: Performed statistical tests to validate hypotheses and draw meaningful conclusions.
Key Findings
Geographical Trends: Analyzed salary variations based on the geographical location of developers.
Experience vs. Salary: Explored the relationship between years of experience and salary.
Language and Framework Impact: Investigated how the choice of programming languages and frameworks correlates with salary.
Open Source Contributions: Explored whether active contributors to open-source projects tend to have higher salaries.
# Future Work
Machine Learning Model: Develop a predictive model to estimate salaries based on various factors.
Extended Data Sources: Incorporate additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
Collaboration: Encourage collaboration and contributions from the GitHub community.
